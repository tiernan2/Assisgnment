This Project Aims to simulate a pedestrian crosswalk system by using the following:
* arduino YUN
* Grove Hat 
* LED light
* Buzzer
* Button
* Pin Wires
The code runs in the following sequence:
1.	The code will be in a default state where there will be no light or buzzer active. 
2.	Then we be a structure in place that once the button is pressed by there will be a 5 second delay before the LED light and buzzer will activate. This lets  the user know it is safe to cross the street.
3.	Once the LED and buzzer are activated they remain on for 8 seconds to allow enough time for pedestrians to cross the crossing.
4.	Once 8 seconds has elapsed the LED and Buzzer go back to their default state where they remain off until prompted by the button again to repeat the sequence again.
